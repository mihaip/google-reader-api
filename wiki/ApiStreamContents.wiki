|| Parameter || Description || Example ||
|| `c` || Continuation token. If a StreamContents response does not represent all items in a timestamp range, it will have a `continuation` attribute. The same request can be re-issued with the value of that attribute put in this parameter to get more items.  || `CJLRnpeNpakC` ||
|| `xt` || Tag to exclude. Items that have this tag will not be in the response. Commonly used to hide read items (i.e. items with the read tag) || `user/-/state/com.google/read` ||
|| `nt` || Timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) of the newest item that you're interested in || `1309018028` ||
|| `ot` || Timestamp (in seconds since the epoch) of the oldest item that you're interested in || `1306426059` ||
|| `n` || Number of items to return (up to a maximum of 1,000). Fewer items are returned faster, but larger batches are more efficient for the backend (i.e. one 40 item request is more efficient than two 20 item requests)  || 40 ||
|| `r` || Ranking method. Possible values are: `n`: newest-first (reverse chronological), `o`: oldest-first (chronological),  `c`: items with most recent commens first || `n` ||

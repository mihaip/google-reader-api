#summary Description of stream IDs exposed by the Google Reader API.

"Streams" refer to collections of items in the Google Reader API. This includes feeds, items with a specific tag, or folders. Stream IDs are are string-based identifiers used to identify streams and are passed to many API methods.

= Feed stream IDs =

Streams that correspond to data that come from crawled feeds are of the form `feed/<feed URL>`, for example:

  * <tt>{{{feed/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/atom.xml}}}</tt>
  * <tt>{{{feed/http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch_feeds?q=mihai%20parparita&hl=en&scoring=d&num=10&output=atom}}}</tt>

= Tag stream IDs =

Tags can be applied to items via the [ApiEditTag edit tag] method and to subscriptions via the [ApiEditSubscription edit subscription] method. Once a tag is applied, the tag is available as a stream, with the tag itself becoming the stream ID.

Tag stream IDs are of the form `user/<user ID>/<tail>`. `<user ID>` is the user's identifier, normally a numeric value obtained from the [ApiUserInfo user info] method, but "`-`" may also be used for authenticated requests to signify the ID of the authenticated user.

`<tail>` is different depending on the kind of tag being used:

== System tag stream IDs ==

System tags have a tail of the form `state/com.google/<type>`. Here are common item-level tags:

   * `user/-/state/com.google/read`: applied to read items
   * `user/-/state/com.google/kept-unread`: applied to items that have been kept unread, removed onc they are marked as read
   * `user/-/state/com.google/starred`: applied to starred items
   * `user/-/state/com.google/broadcast`: applied to shared items
   * `user/-/state/com.google/like`: applied to liked items

Here are common subscription-level tags:

   * `user/-/state/com.google/reading-list`: applied to all subscriptions, corresponds to the "All items" view in the UI
   * `user/-/state/com.google/broadcast-friends`: applied to the shared items of the users that are being followed, subscriptions, corresponds to the "People you follow" view in the UI

== User-created tag stream IDs ==

User-created tags are added to items via the "Add tags" or "Edit tags" UI. They are of the form `user/-/label/<name>`, for example:

  * `user/-/label/Foo`
  * `user/-/label/Foo Bar`
  * `user/-/label/Foo Barâ„¢`

Any character may be used as the name with the exception of:  <tt>{{{" ^ < > ? & \ /,}}}</tt>.

== Folder stream IDs ==

Folder stream IDs are the same as user-created tag stream IDs (i.e. they are in the same namespace).

= Use in URLs =

When used as query parameters, stream IDs should be escaped as usual. More subtly, when used in paths (e.g. for the [ApiStreamContents stream contents method]) the stream ID should be escaped too.

  * *Correct*: <tt>{{{http://www.google.com/reader/api/0/stream/contents/feed%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dfoo}}}</tt>
